Every actor who has acted with Kevin Bacon in a movie is assigned a "Bacon number" of 1, every actor who acted with someone who acted with Kevin Bacon is given a "Bacon number" of 2, and so on.

This lab explores the notion of the Bacon number using breadth first search to find paths between actors and movies.
